Learn how to describe clothes and colours in Spanish with these handy words and phrases.

### Describing what you wear

If you want to talk about what you wear in Spanish, a really useful verb to know is **llevar** (to wear).

If you want to say 'I wear' something, you can use **llevo**.

By adding a noun afterwards, you can explain what type of clothes you wear, for example:

- *Llevo un jersey* – I wear a jumper
- *Llevo un abrigo* – I wear a coat

Have a look at the Spanish vocabulary for clothes and see how many you can remember:

| Spanish      | English      |
|--------------|--------------|
| un jersey    | a jumper     |
| un abrigo    | a coat       |
| una falda    | a skirt      |
| una camiseta | a t-shirt    |
| una camisa   | a shirt      |
| una gorra    | a cap        |
| una bufanda  | a scarf      |

Remember that in Spanish the *ll* sound is pronounced as a ‘y’.

- *Llevo una camisa* – I wear a shirt

### Clothes and Classroom Routines

You have seen clothes items with **indefinite articles** (un and una which both mean 'a') and here we have the same examples but with **definite articles** (el and la which both mean 'the').

Remember to use *un* for masculine singular nouns and *una* for feminine.
