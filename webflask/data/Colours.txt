### Describing things

In Spanish, all nouns are either masculine or feminine, as well as singular (when there is only one thing) or plural (when there is more than one of something).

This means an adjective (like a colour) needs to match the noun it is describing, and it does this by changing its spelling.

Here is a table of how colours change:

| Masculine singular (un) | Feminine singular (una) | Masculine plural (unos) | Feminine plural (unas) | English  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|----------|
| negro                   | negra                   | negros                  | negras                 | black    |
| blanco                  | blanca                  | blancos                 | blancas                | white    |
| rojo                    | roja                    | rojos                   | rojas                  | red      |
| morado                  | morada                  | morados                 | moradas                | purple   |
| amarillo                | amarilla                | amarillos               | amarillas              | yellow   |
| azul                    | azul                    | azules                  | azules                 | blue     |
| verde                   | verde                   | verdes                  | verdes                 | green    |
| marrón                  | marrón                  | marrónes                | marrónes               | brown    |
| gris                    | gris                    | grises                  | grises                 | grey     |
| naranja                 | naranja                 | naranja                 | naranja                | orange   |
| rosa                    | rosa                    | rosa                    | rosa                   | pink     |

A lot of the colours follow the same pattern:

### Singular nouns

**Masculine noun (singular)**  
The colour ends in o.

- un jersey rojo - a red jumper

**Feminine noun (singular)**  
The colour ends in a.

- una falda roja - a red skirt

### Plural nouns

As well as an o or a, the colour has an s at the end:

**Masculine (plural)**  
- dos jerseys rojos - two red jumpers

**Feminine (plural)**  
- dos faldas rojas - two red skirts

You might have noticed that not all colours follow the patterns above. These are called 'irregular' adjectives.

Some colours only change spelling when they are plural, and a few don't change at all.

Examples:

- **azul** only changes for plural
  - un vestido azul - a blue dress
  - una falda azul - a blue skirt
  - unos zapatos azules - blue shoes

- **naranja** never changes
  - un vestido naranja - an orange dress
  - una falda naranja - an orange skirt
  - unos zapatos naranja - orange shoes
