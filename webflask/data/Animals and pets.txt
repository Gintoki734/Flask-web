## Describing your pets

To ask someone if they have a pet, you can use the question:

**¿Tienes un animal en casa?** - Do you have a pet?

( It literally means: 'Do you have an animal in the house?' )

If you want to describe what pets you have, you can use the verb **tener** (to have).

If you want to say **'I have'**, you say **tengo**, for example:

- **Tengo un perro** - I have a dog

Try using **tengo** to create a sentence with the animals below:

| Spanish        | English  |
| -------------- | -------- |
| **un perro**   | a dog    |
| **un gato**    | a cat    |
| **un ratón**   | a mouse  |
| **un pájaro**  | a bird   |
| **un conejo**  | a rabbit |
| **un caballo** | a horse  |

You can also use colours to describe your pets, for example:

- **Tengo un perro negro** - I have a black dog
- **Tengo un gato naranja** - I have an orange cat
- **Tengo un ratón blanco** - I have a white mouse

## Giving names

To add your pet’s name, you can use **se llama** (it is called) or **se llaman** (they are called).

- **Tengo un pez naranja. Se llama Rocky** - I have an orange fish. It is called Rocky.
- **Tengo dos perros. Se llaman Rollo y Sam** - I have two dogs. They are called Rollo and Sam.

## Favourite animals

As well as your pets at home, you can also try describing your favourite animal in Spanish.

To ask somebody about their favourite animal in Spanish, you can say:

**¿Cuál es tu animal favorito?** - What is your favourite animal?

You can start your answer with:

**Mi animal favorito es…** - My favourite animal is…

Try adding some of these animals to the sentence:

| Spanish         | English     |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| **un mono**     | a monkey    |
| **un pez**      | a fish      |
| **una jirafa**  | a giraffe   |
| **un león**     | a lion      |
| **un elefante** | an elephant |

## Saying 'because'

You can add more detail to your sentence to say why the animal is your favourite.

To give a reason and to say **'because'** you can add the conjunction **porque** (because), for example:

- **Mi animal favorito es un león porque es feroz** - My favourite animal is a lion because it's fierce

Take a look at the adjectives below and try to extend your sentence:

| Spanish         | English     |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| **feroz**       | fierce      |
| **grande**      | big         |
| **pequeño**     | small       |
| **inteligente** | intelligent |
| **simpático**   | friendly    |

## The 'e' sound

The word **'remember'** in English has three different ‘e’ sounds - ‘ee’, ‘eh’ and ‘er’.

Unlike English, it is important to know that the ‘e’ sound is always pronounced the same way in Spanish.

For example, **un elefante** (an elephant) has three **e**’s that all sound the same.

Here are some more examples of the 'e' sound in Spanish:

| Spanish       | English  |
| ------------- | -------- |
| **un perro**  | a dog    |
| **un conejo** | a rabbit |
| **un pez**    | a fish   |
