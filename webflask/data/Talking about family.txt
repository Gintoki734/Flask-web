## Asking names

To ask **'What is your… called?'** use the question:

- **¿Cómo se llama tu…?** (for one person - singular)  
- **¿Cómo se llaman tus…?** (for two or more people - plural)

Examples:

- **¿Cómo se llama tu madre?** - What’s your mum called?
- **¿Cómo se llama tu padre?** - What’s your dad called?
- **¿Cómo se llaman tus hermanos?** - What are your brothers called?

## Giving names

To talk about one person’s name (singular), use **Se llama…** – He / She is called

Examples:

- **Se llama Angus** - He is called Angus
- **Se llama Maria** - She is called Maria

To talk about two or more people’s names (plural) use **Se llaman… y…** – They are called… and…

Examples:

- **Se llaman Sally y Paul** - They are called Sally and Paul

## Saying 'My'

'**My**' in Spanish is either **mi** (singular) or **mis** (plural).

- **mi hermano** - my brother
- **mis hermanos** - my brothers

You can then add either **se llama** (singular) or **se llaman** (plural) to the person’s name.

Examples:

- **Mi padre se llama Jakob** - My dad is called Jakob
- **Mi hermana se llama Alisha** - My sister is called Alisha
- **Mis padres se llaman Farha y Donald** - My parents are called Farha and Donald

## The 'í' sound

Some letters in Spanish have an accent, such as **í**.

The accent is always above a vowel, as in **tío** (uncle), and it indicates where to place stress in the word.

The **í** sound is pronounced as an **‘ee’**.
