### Describing where you are going

When getting out and about it’s important to know the places around the town.

To describe where you are going you can use the verb **ir**.

This is an irregular verb, which means when talking in different tenses or about yourself it can look different.

- Voy a casa - I am going home
- Voy al colegio - I am going to school
- Voy al cine - I am going to the cinema
