## Talking About Weather

When talking about the weather and seasons in Spanish, there are two main verbs used:

- **hacer** - it does / it makes
- **hay** - there is / there are

**Hacer** is the verb most commonly used.

When using **hacer** to describe the weather, the verb changes to **hace**.

The literal translation of **hace** is "it makes." For example, **hace calor** means, literally, "it makes heat" or "it does heat," but in English, it sounds more natural to say "it is hot."

### Examples of Using "Hace"

| Spanish     | English       |
|-------------|---------------|
| hace calor  | it is hot     |
| hace fresco | it is cool    |
| hace sol    | it is sunny   |
| hace frío   | it is cold    |

To ask what the weather is like, the question is:

**¿Qué tiempo hace?** - What is the weather like?

## The Silent 'H'

In Spanish, **'h'** isn’t pronounced.

Instead, it is silent, so it’s important to remember to emphasize the first vowel sound after the silent **'h'**.

For example, when you say **hace** (it is), the emphasis should be on the **'a'**.

### Did You Know?

Like in English, in Spanish, some verbs can be used on their own to form weather phrases.

- The verb **llover** means 'to rain,' so when describing that it is raining, the verb changes to **llueve** (it rains).

- Another example is the verb **nevar** (to snow).

  To say 'it snows,' the verb changes to **nieva**.

## Talking About Seasons

The weather in Spain can differ depending on which part you are visiting.

In Winter, it’s usually very cold, and in Summer, it’s usually very hot.

### Spanish Words for the Seasons

| Spanish    | English  |
|------------|----------|
| primavera  | Spring   |
| verano     | Summer   |
| otoño      | Autumn   |
| invierno   | Winter   |

You can use the weather and season phrases together to create sentences. For example:

- **En primavera hace sol** - In spring it's sunny
- **En verano hace calor** - In summer it's hot
- **En otoño hace fresco** - In autumn it's cool
- **En invierno hace frío** - In winter it's cold
