## Spanish food

Food and drink is a big part of Spanish culture.

Many dishes come in the form of tapas, which are small portions that everyone shares.

Here are some dishes that you may find on a menu:

| Spanish          | English    |
|------------------|------------|
| el pan           | bread      |
| el pescado       | fish       |
| la pizza         | pizza      |
| la paella        | paella     |
| el queso         | cheese     |
| el jamón         | ham        |
| las fajitas      | fajitas    |
| los tomates      | tomatoes  |

### Giving your opinions on food

To describe your favourite food in Spanish, you can use the verb **gustar**, which means ‘to like’.

To say ‘I like’, use **me gusta**, for example:

- Me gusta el pan - I like bread
- Me gusta la pizza - I like pizza

### Plurals

Some foods need to be plural because there are more than one.

In this case, it’s important to use the correct article.

For plurals, instead of **la** use **las** and instead of **el** use **los**, for example:

- las patatas fritas - chips
- las verduras - vegetables
- los bocadillos - sandwiches

When saying what you like in plural, use **me gustan**, for example:

- Me gustan las patatas fritas - I like chips
- Me gustan los bocadillos - I like sandwiches

### Negatives

To say you don’t like something, you can use **no me gusta** for singular nouns or **no me gustan** for plural nouns.

- No me gusta la pizza - I don’t like pizza
- No me gustan las fajitas - I don’t like fajitas

### Asking about opinions

To ask if someone likes something, use **¿Te gusta…?** with singular nouns or **¿Te gustan….?** with plural nouns. Both of these mean *Do you like…?*

- ¿Te gusta la pizza? - Do you like pizza?
- ¿Te gustan las fajitas? - Do you like fajitas?
